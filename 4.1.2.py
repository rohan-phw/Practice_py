# Rajesh is very new to writing a research article. 
# He follows the bibliography style as first name followed by last name. 
# But the editor wants name in reverse order, i.e. last name, first name. 
# So write a python program to read first name and last name from users and print it in reverse order.
name = str(input())
surname = str(input())
print(surname+","+name)
