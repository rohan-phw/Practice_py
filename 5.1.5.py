#A shopkeeper in a village area near NCR purchases old products from a vender. 
# Later, at the time of sell, he realizes that some of the products donâ€™t have market in his village. 
# So he needs to give offers and reduce the cost of these products. 
# So write a python program which allows the user to enter the Sales amount and Actual cost of a Product, 
# and calculates the Loss Amount or profit Amount based on those two values using if-else Statement.
